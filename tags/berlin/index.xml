      <description>The skatepark in Berlin Buch is brand new and has a bowl and a street section. The bowl has coping all around. The whole area is quite nice as is surounded by greenery and trees. The street section has a half bowl which is not as high as the bowl itself, so you can practice some drop-ins there. A bit further up is a smaller quarter which is also good to practice some drop-ins.</description>
