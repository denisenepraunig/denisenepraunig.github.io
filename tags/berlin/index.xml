      <description>The Bernau Skatepark features a bowl, segmented into sections with and without coping, complimented by a roll-in. Additionally, it offers a street section equipped with a quarter-pipe and a bank. The skatepark was build by Popul√§r Skateparks in 2017. During my visit to the skatepark last year, I unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have my surfskate with me, so I&amp;rsquo;m unable to provide specific insights into the rideability of the bowl. However, the park was new at the time and I did observe the concrete was impressively smooth.</description>

      <description>The Berlin Buch Skatepark, which opened in 2020, features both a bowl and a street section. The bowl is fully equipped with coping around its perimeter, and the site is pleasantly surrounded by lush greenery and trees.
The street section incorporates a half-size bowl, an ideal spot for practicing drop-ins without the intimidating height of the full bowl. Not far from there, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a smaller quarter pipe - another great piece to practice drop-ins.</description>
