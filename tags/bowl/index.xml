      <description>The skatepark Bernau features a bowl with coping and sections without a coping and a roll-in. There is also a street section with a quarter and a bank. The skatepark was build by Popul√§r Skateparks. When I visited the skatepark last year I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a board with me, so I can&amp;rsquo;t say any specifics about how the bowl rides. The park is new so the concrete was very smooth.</description>

      <description>The skatepark in Berlin Buch is brand new and has a bowl and a street section. The bowl has coping all around. The whole area is quite nice as is surounded by greenery and trees. The street section has a half bowl which is not as high as the bowl itself, so you can practice some drop-ins there. A bit further up is a smaller quarter which is also good to practice some drop-ins.</description>
