The skatepark in Berlin Buch is brand new and has a bowl and a street section. The bowl has coping all around. The whole area is quite nice as is surounded by greenery and trees. The street section has a half bowl which is not as high as the bowl itself, so you can practice some drop-ins there. A bit further up is a smaller quarter which is also good to practice some drop-ins. In the bank section you can practice your first slides.</p>
<p>A bit further away is a big supermarket where there is also toilet. Next to the super market is a small shopping area where you can also get some Döner Kebap. The <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7RwfAmcMcEugHGLP8">closest S-Bahn station</a> is S2.</p>
<p>I was there on a Saturday in October after lunch and it was still pretty chill. In the afternoon more scooter kids and BMX people arrived.</p>
<p>Photos are from August 2022 and October 2023.</p>

<p>The toilet was inside the Kaufland supermarket and I bought some snacks. Keep in mind that shops/supermarkets in Germany are generally closed on Sundays.</p>
