      <description>Hello, my name is Denise Nepraunig and I started skateboarding and surfskating at 36 years old in August 2021. I am from Austria and currently live in Berlin.
I enjoy cruising around on my surfskate in bowls and on pumptracks.
I love the flowy feeling of surfskates and I don&amp;rsquo;t use them as surftrainers because I can&amp;rsquo;t surf. As far as my skatebording abilities go, I&amp;rsquo;m still working on my ollie and it will be a long way until my first kickflip.</description>

      <description>The skatepark in Berlin Buch is brand new and has a bowl and a street section. The bowl has coping all around. The whole area is quite nice as is surounded by greenery and trees. The street section has a half bowl which is not as high as the bowl itself, so you can practice some drop-ins there. A bit further up is a smaller quarter which is also good to practice some drop-ins.</description>
